# File List Creator

This was developed the day before *AV494* exam as the resources for exam was too much.

## Python implementation

Using os library simply outputs the list of files in the directory it is run in to `list_of_files.txt`.

## Usage

Simply copy the `list_of_files.exe` to the directory you want file list in and double click to run.
You will get the file list in the same directory.
